	Only 34% of elementary classes meet a class-size cap of 20 students, analysis of Department of Education data shows. If the city can’t reduce overcrowding by September 2025, the state could withhold $800 million for the public school system. 

</p>

<p>
	60% of classrooms must fall within the size requirements by the deadline. With nine months to go, schools in Brooklyn and Queens remain the most overcrowded.

	Majority of the overcrowded classes are in Queens, where 84% of the borough’s classrooms are over limit. Queens has been the most overcrowded borough for decades, according to <a href = "https://www.nyc.gov/html/records/pdf/govpub/2657school_crowding.pdf"> government reports </a>. 
	</p>
	
		<p>
	Advocates blame the lagging progress on a lack of construction.
		</p>

			<p>
			“School overcrowding is due to enrollment growth that has not been met with sufficient school construction,” said Leonie Haimson, the executive director of Class Size Matters, which lobbies for smaller classes in the city. 
</p>
<p>
				Class Size Matters started a petition pushing the Department of Education to hire more teachers and to stop allowing exemptions to class size law which permits overcrowding. If 60% of classes are not under the limit by September 2025, the state could withhold $800 million in funding for the public school system each year.
			</p>
			<p>

				Reducing elementary class sizes doesn’t just impact the student’s school experience, but their future as well, says Haimson. 

			</p>
			<p>

				“Evidence shows that smaller classes in the early grades leads to better student outcomes in every way that can be measured; in terms of grades, test scores, behavior, grad rates, college-going, and owning their own homes more than 20 years later,” Haimson said.

				The city has placed the responsibility to reduce class sizes on superintendents, allowing school districts to consider splitting classes and offering virtual options, according to Chalkbeat. Some have found ways to meet the class size requirements without building more classrooms or hiring teachers, <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2024/09/04/class-size-deadline-looms-september-2025-preparations-still-piecemeal/"> according to Chalkbeat.</a> 

</p>
<p>
				For Haimson, construction is the only solution to overcrowding, and the School Construction Authority recently received an additional $2 billion over five years to do just that. However, construction remains the slowest and most expensive route to solving this problem, <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2024/09/04/class-size-deadline-looms-september-2025-preparations-still-piecemeal/"> according to Chalkbeat.</a>
